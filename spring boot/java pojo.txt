A JavaBean is still a POJO but introduces a strict set of rules around how we implement it:

Access levels – our properties are private and we expose getters and setters
Method names – our getters and setters follow the getX and setX convention (in the case of a boolean, isX can be used for a getter)
Default Constructor – a no-argument constructor must be present so an instance can be created without providing arguments, for example during deserialization
Serializable – implementing the Serializable interface allows us to store the state
